      <h3>Travel Cost Reimbursements</h3>
      <p>
        We will be able to reimburse a small amount of your travel costs. The amount you will be able to claim depends on where you're coming from:<br>
        You can apply for up to £30 for distances as far as london,<br>
        Up to £50 for distances as far as Manchester,<br>
        And £70 for distances further than Manchester (including international)<br>
      </p>
      <p>We will send more details on travel reimbursements, and we may be processing them at the event. Make sure you keep your receipts!</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> We won’t be reimbursing parking costs or cost of travel if you have indicated that you will be travelling on one of our coaches, nor will we be reimbursing any students who study locally. We ask that you be responsible about claiming travel reimbursements and only do so if appropriate — we reserve the right to deny travel reimbursements.

        For those of you that are travelling from further afield, we are endeavouring to find people in Cambridge willing to offer up some accommodation space for you on the Friday night before Hack Cambridge (the 27th of January), in which case you’ll just need to bring a sleeping bag and a pillow. However, at present, we can’t guarantee you a place, so please apply early

        <h4>Coaches</h4>
        <p>
          If you’re from the UK, we may be able to send coaches from your city to the hackathon and back. We need to gauge interest to determine if this is useful. Do you want a coach sent to you? Express interest on <a href="{{ coachesForm }}" target="_blank">this form</a> and we’ll get back to you asap. Note: If you express interest on this form and we do send a coach to your city, we will not reimburse your cost of travel.

      <section>
        <h4>Train</h4>
        <p>
          The nearest train station is Cambridge train station. It’s an approximately 30-minute walk from there to the venue. Which is a great way to wake you up nicely!<br>

        <h4>By Car</h4>
        <p>
          We encourage you to avoid driving to Hack Cambridge if possible — parking is hard to find and isn’t cheap around the venue. If you have no choice but to drive, we recommend you park at the train station (Cambridge Station) about 30 minutes walking away (see above) to save yourself the £50 parking charge. Other alternatives can be found <a href="http://en.parkopedia.co.uk/parking/carpark/cambridge_station/cb1/cambridge/?arriving=201701280730&leaving=201701291600">here</a>.

      <section>
        <h4>By Air</h4>
        <p>
          If you are an international student and will be flying, we recommend you head for Stansted Airport, our closest international airport, if possible. From there, National Express offer a 50-minute coach journey to Cambridge for just £8. For more information on that coach and coaches from other airports, visit <a href="http://coach.nationalexpress.com/nxbooking/journey-search">nationalexpress.com</a>
